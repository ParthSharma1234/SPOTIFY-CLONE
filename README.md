ðŸŽµ Spotify Web Player Clone
This project is a carefully crafted Spotify-inspired music player clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike just another "Spotify copy," this one is designed with:

âœ¨ Clean & responsive UI â€“ modern layout that works smoothly across devices.
ðŸŽ§ Custom player features â€“ play, pause, next/previous, progress bar, and volume control.
âš¡ Dynamic interactions â€“ seamless JavaScript functionality for a real music player feel.
ðŸŽ¨ Attention to detail â€“ polished styling, icons, and animations for a professional look.
ðŸ“‚ Organized codebase â€“ beginner-friendly structure with clear HTML, CSS, and JS separation.

I created this project to strengthen my frontend development skills and pay attention to design, responsiveness, and JavaScript interactivity.
This isnâ€™t just a basic cloneâ€”itâ€™s a project where Iâ€™ve put real effort into making it functional, visually appealing, and unique in execution.
